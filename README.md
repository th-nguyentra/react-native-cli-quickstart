**TECHNICAL STACK**

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/): React Native is a popular JavaScript framework used for building mobile applications. It allows developers to write mobile apps using React, which is originally designed for web applications.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/): React Navigation is a library used to handle navigation in a React Native application. It provides a set of navigators like StackNavigator, TabNavigator, and DrawerNavigator to create navigation flows within the app.
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand): Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable barebones state management solution using simplified flux principles. It offers a comfy API based on hooks.
- [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest): React Query is a powerful asynchronous state management and data fetching library for the web with zero dependencies.
- [React Native SVG](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg): React Native SVG allows you to render SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) images in your React Native applications. It enables the use of vector graphics and icons instead of traditional image assets.
- [FakerJs](https://fakerjs.dev/): FakerJs is a JavaScript library used to generate fake data for testing and development purposes. It can be handy when you need to populate your app with dummy data.
- [MockAPI](https://mockapi.io/projects): MockAPI is a tool that allows you to create mock APIs quickly. It helps in development and testing by simulating backend responses before the actual backend is ready.
- [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/): Mock Service Worker is another library that helps in mocking APIs and intercepting network requests during testing and development. It allows you to work with real API responses while keeping the actual network calls isolated.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/): Jest is a widely-used testing framework for JavaScript applications. It provides a powerful and easy-to-use testing platform, enabling you to write unit tests, integration tests, and snapshot tests for your React Native components.
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/): React Testing Library is a simple and complete testing utility that encourages good testing practices. It is a lightweight solution for testing web pages by querying and interacting with DOM nodes.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): Storybook is an open-source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation.
- [React Push Notification](https://github.com/zo0r/react-native-push-notification): React Native Local and Remote Notifications for iOS and Android.
